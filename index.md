# About Me

Hi! My name is Ryan Cheng. I'm currently 16 years old and a junior attending The Nueva School. My academic interests primarily include Math and Computer Science. Outside of school, my hobbies involve sports and music. I play three sports (Basketball, Tennis, and Volleyball) and am also an avid drummer. I hope to study Computer Science in the future as I am passionate in exploring the endless possibilities surrounding technology.
