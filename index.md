# About Me

Hi! My name is Ryan Cheng. I'm currently a junior attending The Nueva School. My academic interests are primarily Math and Computer Science. Outside of school, I love playing sports and music. I play three sports (Basketball, Tennis, and Volleyball) and am also an avid drummer. I'm looking forward to studying Computer Science in the future as I'm passionate in exploring the endless possibilities surrounding technology.
